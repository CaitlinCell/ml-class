\begin{abstract}
Recent studies have suggested the brain is composed of clusters that are in communication with each other. Using this as a basis, we propose a feed-forward neural network that is formed with clusters instead of individual neurons at each layer. Preliminary results suggest that this type of network has detrimental effects on the rate of network accuracy and convergence. Further work should be done to create a better model of these recent studies of the brain.
