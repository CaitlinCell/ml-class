There is an ever-growing volume of patents being produced. The classification of these patents into useful categories is a necessary first step in allowing them to be evaluated by experts. We explored several supervised classification techniques and feature sets to classify patents into human-created categorization, as well as techniques to evaluate the coherence of these classifications against unsupervised clustering techniques. %Finally, we discuss the difficulty of the task and examine the natural lexical clustering of patent topics to show how the man made categories hinder machine learning attempts <- ((something like that but better)) attempt to determine if the current category classifications are actually natural given a sample of patents, or if there may exist more natural classification categories than are already in use.
